## STA208 Project: Predicting BBBP Using Machine Learning/Deep Learning

#### Overview
This project for the STA208 class focuses on predicting Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration (BBBP) using various machine-learning models. The task is defined as a binary classification (0/1)

#### Dataset
We use a dataset of approximately 2000 small molecules, each characterized by SMILES strings, along with their corresponding BBBP properties. \
The data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyanagda/bbbp-smiles).

#### Methodology
Descriptor generation: The descriptors are generated by RDKit \
Exploratory Data Analysis: Including descriptive statistics, visualization, and PCA. \
Machine Learning Models: Utilizing SVM, LDA, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Mixture, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. \
Deep Learning Approach: Explored various parameters within a simple NN architecture using the Weights & Biases (wandb) sweep functionality for hyperparameter tuning.
